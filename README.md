# Tyler's dotfiles

This is my public collection of personal dotfiles, including files configuring oh-my-zsh, tmux, neovim, and more.

## Disclaimer

If you want to try using these dotfiles, you should review what they do first. Blindly using another's configurations, shell scripts, etc. is a very dangerous and discouraged practice. These files are offered without condition and it is up to the end-user to ensure they are a proper fit, caveat emptor.
